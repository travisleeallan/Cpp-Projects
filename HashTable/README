I have included a bash script(mostly for practice) to compile the program.
The program is written completely in c++, the bash file is just there for your convenience.
To compile all that you need to do is:
	1. Make sure that you are in the directory that holds these files.
	2. enter: source HashBash.sh
	3. Wait for the program to compile.

Everything else is included in the program's menu. 

The file named “Program Build Log” shows the terminal’s read out from the start of the project to the end, where it is completed and running correctly.

Thanks, have a nice day!
